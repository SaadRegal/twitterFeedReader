# View Source

This project was Made with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.2.

# Note about dynamic style: 
Manipulation of DOM is not a good practice to change theme/palette, using multiple CSS stylesheet files makes it a thousand time easier, but since this project is using [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) as styling framework, I though Iâ€™ll be better to reuse the code,by swapping classes. But on the bright side, now `.ui` elements can follow our theme color by only adding `.theme` class to it, and also it gives us access to all theming colors in semantic UI .

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
