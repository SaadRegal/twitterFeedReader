#  Frontend Code Challenge

## Setup

Install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

## Running

Update config.json with your Twitter API credentials.
Start the static and proxy servers:

`npm start`

This server will help you to get Twitter's API to send you tweets without you needing to do any authentication.  You don't need to modify server.js at all.
